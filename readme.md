A simple example webpage that uses CSS and jQuery to generated a Tweet button when the user highlights text. It also changes the background color of the selection to "Twitter blue" when the selected text is less than 90 characters (an arbitrary number).

Think I tried to use this to get a frontend dev job back in 2014?
